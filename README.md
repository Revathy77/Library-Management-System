A console-based Java application that manages books and members in a digital library. The system allows registering members, adding books, issuing and returning books, and listing issued or available items â€” all built using strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

Key Features:

* Add and list books with title, author, and ISBN
* Register library members with name and unique ID
* Issue and return books (only if available)
* Prevent duplicate ISBNs (validation logic)
* View all available or issued books
* View registered members

Technologies & Concepts Used:

* Java OOP (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
* Collections Framework (`List`, `Map`, `ArrayList`, `HashMap`)
* Lambda Expressions and Streams for filtering
* `Optional` to handle missing books safely
* toString() and @Override for clean object representation


How It Works :

* Users interact via a text-based menu
* Can perform all tasks (add, issue, return, list)
* Built entirely in Java, suitable for CLI-based library simulation
